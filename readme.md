# MENBSIM
## Multipole N Body Simulation

 This project is done at the University of Zurich for the course "Computational Astrophysics". The implementation consists of a simulation set-up, a multipole solver as well as a tailored oct-tree to solve the N body system in 3 dimensions.

## Dependencies
### Running the Simulation:
 - Eigen
 - OMP
 - gcc(__gnu_parallel)

### Plotting:
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Python3
 - Matplotlib

## Usage
### Compiling:
Use the provided make.sh script in the scripts folder
### Running the Simulation:
//TODO(dave): write usage
